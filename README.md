# landing-page-with-tailwind

This project details how I was able to build a landing page with just html and css.

It is a non-interactive landing page and the CSS convention used to style/design the page is tailwind CSS

The tailwind CSS method of adding CSS classes involves installing tailwind script on the project which scans  
and watch for all CSS classes present in HTML files which are written inside the html tags.
